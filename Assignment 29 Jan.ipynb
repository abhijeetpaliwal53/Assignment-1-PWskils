    "Ans 14 - Memory management in Python is handled automatically by the Python interpreter through a process called garbage collection. The garbage collector in Python automatically detects and frees memory that is no longer being used by the program, which helps to prevent memory leaks and other issues that can arise from manual memory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses a system of reference counting to keep track of objects in memory. Each object in memory has a reference count, which is the number of variables and other objects that are currently referring to it. When the reference count of an object reaches zero, the garbage collector automatically frees the memory used by the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to reference counting, Python also uses a generational garbage collection scheme, which divides objects into different generations based on their age. New objects are placed in the youngest generation, and as they age and survive garbage collection cycles, they are promoted to older generations. This helps to improve the efficiency of garbage collection by reducing the amount of memory that needs to be scanned during each cycle."
