    "ANS 1 - In Python, the open() function is used to open a file. It is used to establish a connection between the Python program and the file on disk, allowing you to read from or write to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The open() function takes two arguments: the file name (or path) and the mode in which you want to open the file. The mode specifies the purpose for which the file is being opened, whether it's for reading, writing, or both.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different modes that can be used to open a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r' (Read Mode): This is the default mode when you don't specify any mode. It is used to open a file for reading. In this mode, the file is positioned at the beginning, and you can only read the contents of the file. If the file does not exist, it will raise a FileNotFoundError exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "'w' (Write Mode): This mode is used to open a file for writing. It creates a new file if it doesn't exist or truncates the file if it does. In other words, it clears the existing content of the file. If the file exists, it will be overwritten. If the file doesn't exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a' (Append Mode): This mode is used to open a file for appending data. It creates a new file if it doesn't exist. If the file exists, the new data will be added to the end of the file. The file pointer is positioned at the end of the file in this mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "'x' (Exclusive Creation Mode): This mode is used to open a file exclusively for writing. It creates a new file but raises a FileExistsError if the file already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "'t' (Text Mode): This is the default mode when opening a file in text format. It is used to read or write textual data. In this mode, the contents of the file are treated as Unicode strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "'b' (Binary Mode): This mode is used to open a file in binary format. It is used for reading or writing non-text data, such as images or audio files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining these modes, you can specify multiple modes by passing them as a string. For example, 'rb' opens the file in binary mode for reading, while 'w+' opens the file for both reading and writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to remember to close the file using the close() method after you're done working with it to free up system resources. Alternatively, you can use the with statement, which automatically takes care of closing the file for you."

    "\n",
