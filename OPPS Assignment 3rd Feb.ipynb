This protects the data from external manipulation and ensures that it is accessed and modified only through controlled methods.\n",

    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects to take on many forms or to exhibit different behaviors depending on the context in which they are used. It allows for the creation of generic code that can be applied to different types of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of identifying essential features of an object while ignoring its implementation details. It allows for the creation of simpler, more generalized models of complex systems, making it easier to reason about them and to create reusable code."
